## Architecture

### Backend Storage

The application uses a file-based persistent storage system that:
- Stores sessions in JSON format
- Automatically cleans up expired sessions every 5 minutes
- Supports custom data directory via `DATA_DIR` environment variable
- Includes automatic date serialization/deserialization
- Provides health check endpoint at `/api/health`

### Technology Stack

- **Next.js 15** - React framework with App Router
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling
- **Radix UI** - Accessible components
- **React Hook Form** - Form handling

## Usage

1. **Create a Session**: Enter JIRA key and story title
2. **Share Session Code**: Participants join using the 4-character code
3. **Vote**: Each participant selects their estimate
4. **Reveal**: Votes are automatically revealed when all participants vote
5. **Finalize**: Choose the final estimate for the story

## Session Management

- Sessions are automatically cleaned up after 15 minutes of inactivity
- Participants are marked inactive after 30 seconds
- Session codes are unique 4-character alphanumeric strings
- All data is stored locally in the browser (static version)
