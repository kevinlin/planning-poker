# Progress: Planning Poker - Zühlke Story Estimation Tool

## What Works

### Core Functionality ✅
- **Session Management**: Create, join, and manage sessions with unique codes
- **Voting System**: Complete Fibonacci scale voting with poker card interface
- **Real-time Updates**: Polling-based real-time updates every 2 seconds
- **Participant Management**: Activity tracking, inactive user display, participant removal
- **Vote Consensus**: Automatic reveal when all participants vote, clear consensus rules
- **Session Lifecycle**: 15-minute expiration, automatic cleanup every 5 minutes

### User Interface ✅
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Zühlke Branding**: Custom gradient header, professional styling
- **Poker Cards**: Interactive cards with hover effects and state indicators
- **Participant List**: Clear display of active/inactive participants
- **Vote Progress**: Visual feedback on voting progress and results
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages and loading states

### Technical Implementation ✅
- **API Architecture**: Complete REST API with proper error handling
- **Data Persistence**: File-based storage that survives server restarts
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation with comprehensive interfaces
- **Component Structure**: Modular, reusable React components
- **Deployment Ready**: Configured for multiple platforms (Vercel, Render, etc.)

### Storage & Performance ✅
- **Persistent Storage**: JSON file-based storage with automatic serialization
- **Data Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of expired sessions
- **Memory Management**: Efficient session management with activity tracking
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of storage errors and network issues

## What's Left to Build

### Immediate Enhancements (Nice to Have)
- **WebSocket Support**: Replace polling with real-time WebSocket connections
- **Session Export**: Export session results to CSV/JSON format
- **Enhanced Analytics**: Track voting patterns and session statistics
- **Improved Mobile UX**: Optimize touch interactions for mobile devices

### Future Features (Out of Current Scope)
- **Multi-story Sessions**: Support multiple stories in a single session
- **User Authentication**: Optional user accounts and session history
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark themes
- **Advanced Voting**: Custom voting scales, async voting options
- **Integration**: Figma plugin, JIRA integration for automatic story import
- **Admin Dashboard**: System metrics, session management interface

### Technical Improvements
- **Database Migration**: Move from file-based to database storage for scalability
- **Caching Layer**: Add Redis or similar for session caching
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement proper rate limiting for API endpoints
- **Monitoring**: Add application monitoring and error tracking
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit and integration test coverage

## Known Issues and Limitations

### Storage Limitations
- **Vercel Ephemeral Storage**: Sessions reset on function cold starts in Vercel
- **Concurrent Access**: No file locking, potential race conditions with simultaneous writes
- **Backup Strategy**: No automated backup of session data
- **Scalability**: File-based storage doesn't scale beyond single server

### Performance Considerations
- **Polling Overhead**: 2-second polling creates unnecessary server load
- **Memory Usage**: All sessions kept in memory, limited by server RAM
- **File I/O**: Frequent file writes may impact performance at scale
- **Network Latency**: Polling-based updates have inherent delay

### User Experience Gaps
- **Network Interruption**: Limited handling of extended network outages
- **Session Recovery**: No mechanism to recover from unexpected session loss
- **Participant Limits**: No enforced limits on participants per session
- **Mobile Optimization**: Some UI elements could be better optimized for touch

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Architecture Decisions
- **Started with**: Simple file-based storage for MVP simplicity
- **Evolved to**: Debounced writes and automatic cleanup for better performance
- **Rationale**: Balance between simplicity and reliability

### Real-time Communication Strategy
- **Considered**: WebSockets for true real-time communication
- **Chose**: Polling for simplicity and deployment compatibility
- **Trade-off**: Slight delay vs. implementation complexity and reliability

### State Management Approach
- **Considered**: Redux or Zustand for complex state management
- **Chose**: Local React state with useEffect polling
- **Rationale**: Sufficient for current scope, easier to maintain

### Storage Strategy Evolution
- **Phase 1**: In-memory storage (sessions lost on restart)
- **Phase 2**: File-based storage with manual saves
- **Phase 3**: Automatic cleanup and debounced writes
- **Future**: Database migration for true scalability

### UI/UX Refinements
- **Initial**: Basic form-based interface
- **Current**: Poker card interface with Zühlke branding
- **Improvements**: Added participant management, vote progress indicators
- **Future**: Enhanced mobile experience, accessibility improvements

## Current Status: Production Ready ✅
The Planning Poker application is **fully functional and ready for production use**. All core requirements have been implemented, the system is stable, and it successfully handles the primary use case of story estimation for agile teams.
