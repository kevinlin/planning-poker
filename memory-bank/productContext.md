# Product Context: Planning Poker - Zühlke Story Estimation Tool

## Problem Statement
Agile teams struggle with efficient story estimation, especially in remote or hybrid work environments. Traditional estimation methods are time-consuming, lack transparency, and can be dominated by vocal team members. Teams need a digital solution that:

- Enables simultaneous, anonymous voting to avoid bias
- Provides clear rules for reaching consensus
- Works seamlessly for distributed teams
- Integrates with existing JIRA workflows
- Maintains session state across network interruptions
- Automatically handles session lifecycle management

The current manual processes often lead to lengthy discussions without clear resolution, inconsistent estimation practices across teams, and difficulty tracking which stories have been estimated.

## User Experience Goals
- **Simplicity**: Users can create and join sessions with minimal steps (JIRA key + title, then share code)
- **Transparency**: All participants can see voting progress and results clearly
- **Engagement**: Poker card interface makes voting interactive and familiar
- **Reliability**: Sessions persist through browser refreshes and network issues
- **Efficiency**: Automatic vote revelation and clear consensus rules reduce ceremony time
- **Accessibility**: Clean, responsive design works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Professional**: Zühlke branding maintains corporate identity and trust

## Success Metrics
- **Adoption**: Number of active sessions created per week
- **Engagement**: Average number of participants per session
- **Efficiency**: Time to reach consensus (from session creation to finalization)
- **Reliability**: Session completion rate (sessions that reach final estimate)
- **User Satisfaction**: Minimal support requests, positive feedback on ease of use
- **Technical Performance**: 99%+ uptime, sub-second response times, successful deployments

## Target Users
- **Primary**: Zühlke engineering teams conducting sprint planning and backlog refinement
- **Secondary**: External agile teams who receive session links
- **Roles**: Scrum Masters (session creators), Developers (voters), Product Owners (observers)

## Key User Journeys
1. **Session Creation**: Scrum Master enters JIRA key and title, receives shareable code
2. **Joining**: Team members enter name and join via code, see participant list
3. **Voting**: Participants select estimates, see voting progress, automatic reveal
4. **Consensus**: Based on vote distribution, either finalize or discuss and revote
5. **Completion**: Final estimate is recorded, session ends automatically
