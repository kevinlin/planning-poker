# Active Context: Planning Poker - Zühlke Story Estimation Tool

## Current Work Focus
The Planning Poker application is **fully functional and deployed**. The core MVP has been completed with all essential features implemented:

- Complete session management system with persistent storage
- Real-time voting with Fibonacci scale poker cards
- Participant management with activity tracking
- Automatic vote revelation and consensus rules
- Responsive UI with Zühlke branding
- RESTful API with comprehensive error handling

## Recent Changes
- **Session Management**: Implemented persistent file-based storage with automatic cleanup
- **Voting System**: Built complete voting flow with poker card interface
- **Participant Tracking**: Added 30-second activity timeout and inactive user display
- **API Architecture**: Created comprehensive REST API with proper error handling
- **UI/UX**: Implemented responsive design with Zühlke gradient branding
- **Deployment**: Configured for multiple platforms (Vercel, Render, DigitalOcean)

## Next Steps
- **Monitoring**: Set up production monitoring and error tracking
- **Performance**: Optimize for larger participant counts if needed
- **Documentation**: Create user guides and deployment documentation
- **Testing**: Add comprehensive test coverage for critical paths
- **Enhancements**: Consider future features like session export or dark mode

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **Storage Strategy**: File-based storage chosen for simplicity, may need database for scale
- **Real-time Updates**: Using polling (2-second intervals) instead of WebSockets for simplicity
- **Session Expiration**: 15-minute timeout balances usability with resource management
- **Deployment**: Vercel recommended for ease of use, but supports multiple platforms
- **Branding**: Zühlke colors and styling maintained throughout for professional appearance

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- **Component Structure**: Modular React components with clear separation of concerns
- **State Management**: Local state with polling for real-time updates (no complex state library)
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error boundaries and user-friendly error messages
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation with proper interfaces
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom Zühlke color variables
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with consistent response formats

## Learnings and Project Insights
- **Simplicity Wins**: File-based storage and polling are sufficient for the use case
- **User Experience**: Poker card interface creates engaging, familiar voting experience
- **Session Management**: Automatic cleanup and expiration prevent resource bloat
- **Deployment Flexibility**: Next.js App Router enables deployment on multiple platforms
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach ensures usability across devices
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of network issues and session expiration maintains user trust
